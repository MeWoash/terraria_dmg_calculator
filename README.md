# ðŸŽ¯ Terraria Damage Calculator & Reforge Simulator

The in-game damage shown on a weapon in **Terraria** doesn't reflect its actual performance in combat. It ignores key factors such as critical strike chance, number of projectiles, attack speed, and enemy defense.

This calculator helps you accurately estimate real DPS based on all these variables.
